# Face-Mask-Detection-using-YOLO-V9e
Objective:
Develop a model to detect face masks in images, distinguishing between masked and unmasked faces.

Model Used:
YOLOv8s (You Only Look Once version 8 small), known for its efficiency in real-time object detection.

Framework:
PyTorch, chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in implementing YOLO models.

Data Preparation:

Annotation Conversion: Transformed the annotations from the standard bounding box format (x1, x2, y1, y2) to the YOLO format (center x, center y, width, height) to fit YOLO's requirements.
Training Details:

Training Duration: 124 epochs, which indicates a thorough training process.
Hardware: Trained on NVIDIA RTX 8000 GPUs, ensuring powerful computational support for deep learning tasks.
Outcomes:

The project likely involved fine-tuning hyperparameters and optimizing performance metrics to achieve accurate face mask detection.
